										 When I played U16 rugby with Bandon, my team and I decided to organise a rugby tour to Wales. We first set off on a 2 hour bus trip to Rosslare harbour in Wexford. From there we took a ferry to Wales and another excruciatingly long bus trip until we finally arrived in Cardiff where we were to spend the 4 day tour. We relied on a private bus to shuttle us around Cardiff and to the neighbouring city of Swansea.  
									
									</li>
										
									<li>

										During our stay we partook in a wide range of activities. We played a friendly exhibition with a local club, and beat them comfortably; watched an ice hockey game between the Cardiff devils and the glasgow clan; visited the Millennium Stadium, home of Welsh rugby, and also got to watch Muster play the Ospreys. You can agree we spent every second doing something exciting.
									
									</li>
									
									<li>

										The best memory I have of the trip was taping our team mate Mark to a luggage rack in the hotel and rolling him down the hall uncontrollably. What made it even better was the hotel porter chasing us up the hall in the opposite direction and almost got hit by the luggage rack. 
									
									</li>

									<li> 

										I certainly will not forget that trip. I feel we all bonded closer together as a team. Hopefully we will be able to organidse another tour in the near future.

										 In June 2017, a number of students and I was selected to represent Ireland  in the European Student Parliment. We were sent to the beautifal city of Toulouse in the South of France where Parliment was to meet.
									
									</li>
										
									<li>

										Each countries' delegates were housed within the student accomodation on Toulouse University Campus, only a 5 minute walk from the city center. The weather was bright and warm and the city was full of awe inspiring sights such as the main square, full of market stalls and the river bank.
									
									</li>
									
									<li>

										At night we would often visit a different restaurant, my favourite was definately Mona Pizza which made one of the the tastiest meat pizzas I have ever tasted. To match the deliciousness of the main course, for dessert we decided to visit a local ice cream shop and sat out in the warm summer evening, cooling off with our frozen treats.

										One of the funniest memories from that week was the time my friend from Israel, Carmen, found her room completely full of cockroaches and was forced to move to a different dorm room. Her bed, her suitcase and clothes, even the fridge had cockroaches inside it. It was hilarously disgusting. I hope that some day I can return to that wonderful city, with a higher standard accomodation next time.

										Last summer, my girlfriend and I decided to go on trip to Dublin City.We began our day by getting the first train from Kent station in Cork and began our 3 hour long journey. Once we arrived in Dublin, we decided to get breakfast in a near by cafe before taking a tour of the Guinness store house. The highlight of the tour was reaching the Gravity Bar at the very top of the building and being welcomed by a 360 degree view of Dublin City. It was truly great experience where many fond memories were made.
									
									</li>
									
									<li>

										Soon after the tour, we set out on a shopping spree, visiting all the major shopping centers such as Ilac Shopping Center and Jervis Shopping Center. Fortunately, along the way we were able to see some amazing sights like the Spire or the Molly Malone Statue.  
									
									</li>

									<li> 

										Once we had finished our purchases, it was nearing the end of the day. We decided to go for dinner to a well known restaurant called Mad Egg which made the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. At about 8pm, we took the luas back to the train station and concluded our journey by taking the final train home. It was not a long distance but was by far one of the most enjoyable trips I've ever taken. I would definately return to Dublin to experience more of what the city has to offer.
